# Handoff Agent Guide

Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository. Two sections matter:
**Conventions** and **The handoff loop**.

---

## 1. What this is

A small Ruby CLI that writes a committed `.handoff.md` beside the code so a
different agent tool can pick up an in-progress task without the conversation.
Plain markdown output on purpose — no agent integration required to read it.

- Ruby 4.0.7, zero runtime dependencies (`open3` and `json` are stdlib).
- CLI at `bin/handoff`, implementation in `lib/handoff/`.

---

## 2. The handoff loop

**This repository is itself a handoff tool, so use it on itself.**

Before starting work:

```console
$ bin/handoff load
```

If a note exists, it describes work already in progress. Follow its
`Next action`. Do not re-derive what the `Decisions` section already settled.

Before finishing:

```console
$ bin/handoff save "<one-line task>"
```

Then fill in, by hand, the sections only a human or agent can know:

- `Decisions` — choices made, including options rejected and why.
- `Tried and failed` — what did not work, and why. **The most valuable
  section.** Two agents handed the same task will retry the same dead end
  unless somebody records it. This information exists nowhere else.
- `Next action` — the single next step, specific enough to start cold.
- `Open questions` — anything unverified or blocked.

Commit the note. That is what makes it survive a context reset or a machine
swap. `State` is machine-derived and regenerates on every save; do not edit it.

## 3. Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `bin/handoff save [TASK]` | Write or update the note. Preserves written sections. |
| `bin/handoff load` | Print the note. |
| `bin/handoff status` | Task plus how many of five human sections are filled. |
| `bin/handoff clear` | Delete the note. |
| `bin/handoff path` | Absolute path to the note. |

## 4. Commands to run

```console
$ bundle install                       # once
$ bundle exec rake                    # specs + rubocop (default task)
$ bundle exec rspec                   # 45 examples
$ bundle exec rubocop                 # lint
$ ruby -Ilib -e 'require "handoff"'   # smoke check
```

`bundle exec rake` is the gate: both specs and RuboCop must be clean.

## 5. Layout

```text
bin/handoff              entry point
lib/handoff.rb           FILENAME, Repo (path lookups), Error
lib/handoff/git.rb       git binary wrapper; returns nil, never raises
lib/handoff/record.rb    markdown in, sections out
lib/handoff/store.rb     file IO
lib/handoff/template.rb  note rendering, git state assembly
lib/handoff/cli.rb       argument dispatch
spec/                    45 examples
.handoff.md              current task note (committed)
```

---

## 6. Conventions

**Git access is read-only and must never raise.** `Handoff::Git` shells out via
`Open3.capture2` with `err: File::NULL` and returns `nil` on any failure —
non-zero exit, empty output, missing binary. Callers handle `nil`, so never
assume a git call succeeded. `Template.observed_state` additionally rescues
`StandardError`, because a failed note is worse than a partial one.

**Memoize carefully.** `Git.root` caches in `@root`; call `Git.reset!` after
changing directory or the cache goes stale. Specs do this via the `in_repo`
helper, which `chdir`s into a tmpdir git repo.

**Parse tolerantly.** `Record.parse` returns empty strings for missing sections
and keeps unrecognized headings under an `other_` key so a hand-written section
survives a rewrite. Never let a malformed note raise.

**Prompts are not content.** A section still holding `_TODO:` counts as empty.
`Template.body_for` regenerates prompts on every render, which is what makes
repeated `save` calls idempotent. If you add a section, add it to
`Record::SECTIONS` and to `Template::PROMPTS`.

**Specs build real repositories.** Use the `in_repo` helper and `commit_all`
from `spec/spec_helper.rb`. Do not stub `Handoff::Git` — the point is to
exercise the actual shell-outs. See
`spec/template_spec.rb` for the pattern of stubbing individual readers when
testing a render path.

**RuboCop is clean and stays that way.** Run it before committing. Two
deliberate relaxations live in `.rubocop.yml`: `Metrics/AbcSize` raised to 27
(three linear methods sit just over the default) and `Style/Documentation`
off. Do not add new exclusions without a comment explaining why.

## 7. Adding a section

1. Add the key and heading to `Record::SECTIONS`.
2. Add a prompt to `Template::PROMPTS` unless the section is machine-derived.
3. Handle it in `Template.body_for` if it needs custom fill behavior.
4. Add parse coverage in `spec/record_spec.rb`.

Order in `SECTIONS` is both display and write order.
